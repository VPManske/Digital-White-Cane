Digital-WHite-Cane 1st prototype of 2018. With much more robust PCB's. This is only a prototype and not close to the final
design. This prototype has the same Time of flight, TOF, sensors and linear resonant actuators, LRA, as the 2017 version. 
It also has a WiFi interface for configuration and debugging and a string WS2812 RGB LEDs for letting us see the
sensor readings in videos.
