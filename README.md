# Digital-White-Cane
The Digital White Cane is a primary electronic mobility head mount aid for use by people who are blind or visually impaired; it is a major "step forward" in assistive technology that allows safe obstacle avoidance and permits navigation around obstacles both in the user's forward path and whatever direction the user turns their head before walking in that direction, giving valuable protection at head/chest height while the cane still cover low ground obstacles.

George wants to make another change.This time to the master in Victors repo.

This time I will ask Victor for approval.
