# Digital-White-Cane

The traditional White Cane has not changed in years. We propose an upgrade using technology that has only recently become avaiable small enough and cheap enough to be used in a consumer scale project.

We use Time of Flight (ToF) optical sensors to measure the distance to obsticals. Multiple sensore mounted at head or chest level report distance data to a microcontroller the converts this information to haptic feedback. The user can "feel" the world around them.
